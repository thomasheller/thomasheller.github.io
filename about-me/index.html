    About me

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                

<h2 id="yoga-and-it">Yoga and IT</h2>

<p>I find that yoga and meditation help me focus my thoughts, be more
creative and productive. The physical exercises compensate for poor
posture that results from many hours of desk work.</p>

<ul>
<li>From June 2015 to June 2016, I worked at <a href="http://www.yoga-vidya.de">Yoga Vidya</a> &#8211; Europe&#8217;s biggest yoga seminar house &#8211; where I provide IT services as well as guiding meditations and being an assistant teacher in yoga classes and teacher training courses. I practice the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites">Five Tibetan Rites</a> daily.</li>
<li>In October 2014, I took several months off from regular work to study yoga source texts like the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> and the <em>Upanishads</em> in-depth and to complete an intensive yoga teacher training course.</li>
<li>As part of my New Year&#8217;s resolution for 2014 to live a healthier life, I started practicing yoga and meditation on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spiritual-experience">Spiritual Experience</h2>

<ul>
<li>In May 2014, I began a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living">simple living</a> project. I greatly reduced my possessions to spend more quality time doing things that really matter. Along the way, I co-founded <a href="http://minimalisten.org/">minimalisten.org</a>, a German-speaking community for simple living enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Since December 2013, I&#8217;ve been following a vegetarian diet for both health and ethical reasons.</li>
<li>During my apprenticeship in Freiburg, I took a Tai Chi and Qi Gong beginners&#8217; class to learn more about the relationship between body, mind and energy.</li>
<li>From 2010 to 2012 I did voluntary work at <a href="http://cru.org">Cru</a> where I helped organizing Christian services for college students.</li>
<li>Wanting to deepen my knowledge of western and eastern religious traditions as well as contemporary movements I took courses in Religious Studies and Protestant Theology at the University of Heidelberg.</li>
<li>During my A levels, I practiced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido">Aikido</a> and meditation for almost a year. I studied the philosophical works of Aikido&#8217;s founder, Ueshiba Morihei, a pacifist and spiritual master.</li>
<li>In 2004, I got acquainted with Traditional Chinese Medicine and Feng Shui, developing a more holistic view of the world.</li>
<li>From 2004 to 2006 I was involved in organizing meet-ups for highly gifted young adults and adults throughout Germany where I got connected to a wide variety of people, interests and world-views.</li>
<li>Although being baptized as a baby in Protestant tradition, I grew up in a largely secular household. I would approve of humanist ideals as put forth by <a href="https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/the-humanist-tradition/20th-century-humanism/gene-roddenberry/">Gene Roddenberry</a> and <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">Eric S. Raymond&#8217;s</a> writings on hacker culture.<br /></li>
